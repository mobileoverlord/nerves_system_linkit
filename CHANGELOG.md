# Changelog

## v0.7.0

When upgrading to this version, be sure to review the updates to
nerves_defconfig. BR2_PACKAGE_ERLANG is no longer selected automatically and
must be added.

  * nerves_system_br v0.7.0
    * Package updates
      * Buildroot 2016.08

    * Bug fixes
      * Many packages were removed. These include Elixir and LFE since neither are
        actually used. Both are added as part of the user build step, so no
        functionality is lost. The most visible result is that the system images
        are smaller and the test .fw file boots to the Erlang prompt.
      * Fix false positive from scrubber when checking executable formats due to
        C++ template instantiations. Ignores SYSV vs. GNU/Linux ABI difference.

      update in the near-term
